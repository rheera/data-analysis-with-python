# Data Analysis with Python

This is the final project for Course 7, _Python Project for Data Analysis_. Part of IBM's Data Analyst Professional Certificate from Coursera. Available here: https://www.coursera.org/programs/jda20232t1-z1hse/professional-certificates/ibm-data-analyst?collectionId=Wxyxq

### Insurance Cost Analysis

For part 1 of this project, we are to perform data analytics on a medical insurance charges dataset. This is a filtered and modified version of the Medical Insurance Price Prediction dataset, available under the CC0 1.0 Universal License on the Kaggle website.

### House Sales in King Count USA

For this project's final part, we are acting as a Data Analyst working at a Real Estate Investment Trust. The Trust would like to start investing in Residential real estate. We are tasked with determining the market price of a house given a set of features. We will analyze and predict housing prices using attributes or features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, number of floors, and so on. The dataset contains house sale prices for King County, which includes Seattle. It includes homes sold between May 2014 and May 2015. It was also slightly modified for this course. It was taken from here: https://www.kaggle.com/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction?utm_medium=Exinfluencer&utm_source=Exinfluencer&utm_content=000026UJ&utm_term=10006555&utm_id=NA-SkillsNetwork-wwwcourseraorg-SkillsNetworkCoursesIBMDeveloperSkillsNetworkDA0101ENSkillsNetwork20235326-2022-01-01.

## Process

### Part 1 - Insurance Cost Analysis

1. Load the data as a pandas DataFrame
2. Clean the data, taking care of the blank entries
3. Run exploratory data analysis and identify the attributes that most affect the charges
4. Develop single variable and multivariable Linear Regression models for predicting the charges
5. Use Ridge regression to refine the performance of Linear regression models.
